# Arrive

Arrive is a mental health journaling app, inspired by the concept of "A Year in Pixels". It was created to allow users a quick and easy way to track their mental health journey and to visualize their mood overtime.

## Technology

Arrive was built using Spring MVC and a HeidiSQL database.

## Usage

The two main user groups Arrive is foucsed to address are those using the application for mental health applications, and those using the app as a sort of visual journal.
For both groups, the importance of the visualization and journaling aspect remain the same. However, the difference lies in the overt medical nature of the application. Do the blog posts focus on being uplifting and speaking to a positive journey, something broad enough to apply to both groups, or focus on helping those with severe depression? The application at this state is ambiguous but could follow either direction.

## Challenges

Previous to this Application, most of my other coding experience has been in javascript, with use of React/React Native, Redux and Node. Using Spring MVC and the Java language presented it's own challenges in thinking of data and adhering to strict Object Oriented Programming concepts.
